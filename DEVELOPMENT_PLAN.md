# VoiceNav MVP Development Plan
## MacBook M3 Pro Edition - UPDATED BASED ON CURRENT PROGRESS

---

## 🎯 WHAT IS VOICENAV?

**VoiceNav is a desktop Python application** that runs in the background on your MacBook and controls your web browser using voice commands.

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  VoiceNav Desktop App (Python)      │
│  - Listens to microphone            │
│  - Processes voice commands         │
│  - Controls browser via Playwright  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓ (controls)
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Chrome/Safari Browser              │
│  - Opens and navigates pages        │
│  - Clicks elements                  │
│  - Reads content aloud              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**NOT:**
- ❌ A browser extension (too limited)
- ❌ A web app (needs system access)
- ❌ A mobile app (different challenge)

**IT IS:**
- ✅ A macOS desktop application (Python-based)
- ✅ Runs as a background service
- ✅ Has a menu bar icon for status/controls
- ✅ Controls your default browser programmatically

### **STAGE 2: Command Parser & Browser Control** ✅ **CORE COMPLETE**
**Goal:** Interpret voice commands and control browser

**Dependencies:** ✅ Stage 1 complete and tested

**Status**: ✅ **70% COMPLETE** - Parser & Integration working, Browser needs fixes

#### Goose Instructions for Stage 2:
```
STAGE 2: Command Parser & Browser Control Integration

Build on: Stage 1 COMPLETE - Maya + Whisper system working

Current System Status:
- ✅ Maya wake word detection working
- ✅ WhisperVoiceListener providing high accuracy
- ✅ Samantha voice feedback functional
- ✅ Factory function: create_voice_listener() defaults to Whisper
- ✅ All Stage 1 tests passing

Tasks for Stage 2:

PART A: Command Parser (src/brain/command_parser.py)

MVP Commands (8 total):
1. "open [website]" → Open URL
2. "go to [website]" → Same as open
3. "click [element]" → Click described element
4. "scroll down" → Scroll down page
5. "scroll up" → Scroll up page
6. "go back" → Browser back button
7. "read page" → Read main content aloud
8. "stop" → Stop current action

Parser Logic:
- Extract intent (open, click, scroll, back, read, stop)
- Extract parameters (website name, element description)
- Return structured action: {
    "intent": "open_url",
    "params": {"url": "google.com"},
    "original": "open google"
  }

URL Normalization:
- "google" → "https://google.com"
- "youtube" → "https://youtube.com"
- "gmail" → "https://gmail.com"
- Handle: "reddit.com" → "https://reddit.com"
- Handle: "bbc.co.uk" → "https://bbc.co.uk"

Element Description Parser:
- "login button" → {"type": "button", "text": "login"}
- "search box" → {"type": "input", "purpose": "search"}
- "red button" → {"color": "red", "type": "button"}

PART B: Browser Control (src/actions/browser_control.py)

Setup:
1. Install Playwright browsers: playwright install chromium
2. Use Playwright (not Selenium - better for M3 Mac)
3. Launch browser in headed mode (visible window)

Core Functions:

1. initialize_browser()
   - Launch Chromium
   - Set viewport: 1280x720
   - Return browser and page objects

2. open_url(url: str)
   - Navigate to URL
   - Wait for page load (wait_for_load_state("networkidle"))
   - Use Maya's voice: "Opened [domain name]"

3. click_element(description: dict)
   - Find element matching description
   - Highlight element (yellow border for 1 second)
   - Click element
   - Use Maya's voice: "Clicked [element]"

4. scroll_page(direction: str, amount: int = 300)
   - Scroll up or down by amount pixels
   - Use Maya's voice: "Scrolling [direction]"

5. go_back()
   - Browser back navigation
   - Use Maya's voice: "Going back"

6. read_content()
   - Extract main article text (ignore nav, ads, footer)
   - Use Maya's voice to speak extracted text
   - Stop reading on "stop" command

Element Finding Strategy:
- Try role-based selectors first: page.get_by_role("button", name="login")
- Fallback to text content: page.locator("text=login")
- Fallback to CSS selectors for common patterns

PART C: Integration Script (src/main.py update)

Integration with existing Maya system:
```python
from input.voice_listener import create_voice_listener
from brain.command_parser import CommandParser
from actions.browser_control import BrowserController

def main():
    # Use the working Maya system
    maya = create_voice_listener(wake_word="hey maya")
    parser = CommandParser()
    browser = BrowserController()
    
    print("🎤 Maya is ready! Say 'Hey Maya' to start.")
    
    while True:
        # Listen for Maya wake word + command
        result = maya.listen_once()
        if result and result.get('raw_text'):
            # Parse the command
            action = parser.parse(result['raw_text'])
            
            # Execute browser action
            browser.execute(action)
```

Testing Scripts:

tests/test_parser.py:
Test these inputs:
- "open google" → {intent: "open_url", params: {url: "https://google.com"}}
- "click login button" → {intent: "click_element", params: {type: "button", text: "login"}}
- "scroll down" → {intent: "scroll", params: {direction: "down"}}
- "read page" → {intent: "read_content"}
- "stop" → {intent: "stop_action"}

tests/test_browser.py:
Automated test:
1. Open browser
2. Navigate to: https://example.com
3. Check page title contains "Example"
4. Scroll down 300px
5. Scroll up 300px
6. Go back (should stay on same page, no history)
7. Close browser
8. Print: "All browser actions successful!"

tests/test_integration.py:
Manual test (run from terminal):
1. Start integration script
2. Say: "Hey Maya"
3. Say: "open google"
4. Verify: Google opens in browser AND Maya says "Opened Google"
5. Say: "Hey Maya"
6. Say: "scroll down"
7. Verify: Page scrolls AND Maya says "Scrolling down"
8. Say: "Hey Maya"
9. Say: "go back"
10. Verify: Browser goes back AND Maya says "Going back"

CHECKPOINT - Must pass before Stage 3:
□ Command parser test: 10/10 commands parsed correctly
□ Browser automation test: All actions complete successfully
□ Integration test: 3/3 voice commands execute properly
□ Maya's voice feedback works for all actions
□ Browser opens visibly (not headless)
□ Works on M3 Mac (ARM architecture)
□ No crashes or Playwright errors
□ Maya system from Stage 1 still fully functional

Integration Notes:
- Reuse Maya's existing Samantha voice system for browser feedback
- Keep the working create_voice_listener() factory function
- Browser control should integrate seamlessly with Maya's responses
- Maintain all Stage 1 functionality while adding browser control
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] command_parser.py complete
- [ ] browser_control.py complete  
- [ ] Integration with Maya system
- [ ] All tests passing

2. Start voice listener (background thread)
3. When wake word detected:
   - Capture command
   - Parse command (Stage 2)
   - Execute action (Stage 2)
   - Maya provides feedback
   - Return to listening
4. Handle "quit maya" → Clean shutdown

Threading:
